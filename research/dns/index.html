      <h2>Rapid growth in Top Level Domains in the Domain Name System</h2>
      <p>
        In recent years, the number of 
        <abbr title="Top Level Domains">TLDs</abbr> in the 
        <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> has been increasing. 
        This is, in part, due to the introduction of ICANN, the aim of which 
        was to promote competition in the registration of domain names.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before the creation of ICANN in 1998 there were a total of eight
        <abbr title="General TLD">gTLD</abbr>; TLD which are not specific to a 
        country or the infrastructure of DNS. These eight were intended to have
        specific uses <code>com</code> for commercial entities, 
        <code>gov</code> for government organisations, etc.) but since then a
        proportion of these have become truly generic.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2000 and 2004 ICANN successfully applied for and instated fifteen 
        new gTLD and have since gone on to create a program which reviews all
        applications for new 
        gTLD[<a name="cite-icann2013gtlds" href=#icann2013gtlds">1</a>].
      </p>

      <h3>Expansion of TLDs</h3>
      <p>
        At time of writing there are a total of 364 TLDs, of which 295 are 
        <abbr title="Country Code TLD">ccTLD</abbr>, 42 gTLD (3 of which are 
        restricted use), 15 sponsored TLD, 11 used for testing and 1 
        (<code>.arpa</code>) dedicated to the infrastructure for 
        DNS[<a name="cite-root2013iana" href="#root2013iana">2</a>].
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two factors which have spurred the growth of TLDs:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Introduction of new gTLD by ICANN</li>
        <li>Support for non-Latin characters in the DNS, allowing for
            <abbr title="Internationalised TLD">ITLD</abbr></li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Until October 
        2009[<a name="cite-icann2013idns" href="#icann2013idns">3</a>] TLD 
        could only consist of US-ASCII (or "Latin") characters. This changed 
        with the approval of the "IDN ccTLD Fast Track 
        Process"[<a name="cite-ican2013final" href="#icann2013final">4</a>], 
        which allows countries to apply for 
        <abbr title="International Domain Name">IDN</abbr> ccTLD allowing users
        to access domains in their own language or script.
      </p>
      <p>
        In more recent years, 2011 to be specific, IDN have also been approved 
        for use in gTLD, allowing for a greater degree of freedom in 
        international users.
      </p>
      <p>
        In hand with this there has been a fair increase in the number of gTLD
        before 2010 there were only 22 gTLD available. On 12 January 2012, 
        applications for new gTLD opened and since then a total of 20 new gTLD 
        have been added, including several IDN.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even so, this is a drop in the ocean compared to the 1,930 applications
        ICANN received and it is anticipated that the number of gTLD will 
        increase further in coming years.
      </p>

      <h3>Non-technical Support of the Expansion of TLDs</h3>
      <p>
        There is much support in favour of the expansion of TLD, much of which
        is non-technical, especially in marketing and branding. The ability to 
        have self-descriptive domain names is obviously appealing to 
        businesses, especially those with well known trademarks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Berneke[<a href="#berneke2013gtlds" name="cite-berneke2013gtlds">5</a>]
        gives ten reasons as to why gTLD are important to businesses, 
        explaining the notable factors such as the ability to have 
        self-descriptive domains which clearly identify the area of a business.
