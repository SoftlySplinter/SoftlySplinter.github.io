      <h2>Rapid growth in Top Level Domains in the Domain Name System</h2>
      <p class="foreward">
        This was a marked essay as part of my universtiy degree but as it was
        highly marked and is an eassy I am genuinely proud of I thought it 
        would be nice to include as an essay on this website.
      </p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        In recent years, the number of 
        <abbr title="Top Level Domains">TLDs</abbr> in the 
        <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> has been increasing. 
        This is, in part, due to the introduction of ICANN, the aim of which 
        was to promote competition in the registration of domain names.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before the creation of ICANN in 1998 there were a total of eight
        <abbr title="General TLD">gTLD</abbr>; TLD which are not specific to a 
        country or the infrastructure of DNS. These eight were intended to have
        specific uses <code>com</code> for commercial entities, 
        <code>gov</code> for government organisations, etc.) but since then a
        proportion of these have become truly generic.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2000 and 2004 ICANN successfully applied for and instated fifteen 
        new gTLD and have since gone on to create a program which reviews all
        applications for new 
        gTLD[<a name="cite-icann2013gtlds" href="#icann2013gtlds">1</a>].
      </p>

      <h3>Expansion of TLDs</h3>
      <p>
        At time of writing there are a total of 364 TLDs, of which 295 are 
        <abbr title="Country Code TLD">ccTLD</abbr>, 42 gTLD (3 of which are 
        restricted use), 15 sponsored TLD, 11 used for testing and 1 
        (<code>.arpa</code>) dedicated to the infrastructure for 
        DNS[<a name="cite-iana2013root" href="#iana2013root">2</a>].
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two factors which have spurred the growth of TLDs:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Introduction of new gTLD by ICANN</li>
        <li>Support for non-Latin characters in the DNS, allowing for
            <abbr title="Internationalised TLD">ITLD</abbr></li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Until October 
        2009[<a name="cite-icann2013idns" href="#icann2013idns">3</a>] TLD 
        could only consist of US-ASCII (or "Latin") characters. This changed 
        with the approval of the "IDN ccTLD Fast Track 
        Process"[<a name="cite-icann2013final" href="#icann2013final">4</a>], 
        which allows countries to apply for 
        <abbr title="International Domain Name">IDN</abbr> ccTLD allowing users
        to access domains in their own language or script.
      </p>
      <p>
        In more recent years, 2011 to be specific, IDN have also been approved 
        for use in gTLD, allowing for a greater degree of freedom in 
        international users.
      </p>
      <p>
        In hand with this there has been a fair increase in the number of gTLD
        before 2010 there were only 22 gTLD available. On 12 January 2012, 
        applications for new gTLD opened and since then a total of 20 new gTLD 
        have been added, including several IDN.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even so, this is a drop in the ocean compared to the 1,930 applications
        ICANN received and it is anticipated that the number of gTLD will 
        increase further in coming years.
      </p>

      <h3>Non-technical Support of the Expansion of TLDs</h3>
      <p>
        There is much support in favour of the expansion of TLD, much of which
        is non-technical, especially in marketing and branding. The ability to 
        have self-descriptive domain names is obviously appealing to 
        businesses, especially those with well known trademarks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Berneke[<a href="#berneke2013gtlds" name="cite-berneke2013gtlds">5</a>]
        gives ten reasons as to why gTLD are important to businesses, 
        explaining the notable factors such as the ability to have 
        self-descriptive domains which clearly identify the area of a business.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is the counter argument that TLD are becoming 
        obsolete[<a href="#leiba2009good" name="cite-leiba2009good">6</a>], 
        tools like search engines and increasingly "intelligent2 web browsers 
        are reducing the need for domain names. Though this is obviously true, 
        there is still a need for a human-readable name to access websites; the
        machine-readable IP addresses are not memorable, or short, enough to 
        easily distribute. Domain names also play a significant part in SEO, 
        although according to Google experts, the new gTLD will not have any 
        kind of preference over existing 
        TLD[<a href="#cutts2012google" name="cite-cutts2012google">7</a>].
      </p>
      <p>
        Another important factor Berneke details the ability to target a 
        international demographic through the new non-Latin IDN. For those 
        demographics which use a non-Latin script, this is a vital element to 
        reach the whole of the target market.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the addition of new TLD comes with a greater range of choice of 
        domain names. Before this there were only 22 gTLD and many of these are
        restricted to specific institutions and organisations, leaving only a 
        handful of domains remaining for non-ccTLD domains.
      </p>
      <p>
        This has led to the overcrowding of the more popular gTLD; 
        <code>.com</code>, <code>.org</code> and <code>.net</code> which has, 
        in turn, ensured that desirable domains are either sparsely available 
        or expensive to purchase. The arrival of these new gTLD is expected to 
        alleviate at least some of this overcrowding, but the author expects 
        that the popular domains will still suffer from this as entrepreneurial
        people snap up these domains at a cheap price and sell them when the 
        market prices are higher.
      </p>
      <p>
        A lot of major search engines are now placing increasing importance of 
        geolocation[<a href="#linkdex2012georanking" 
                       name="cite-linkdex2012georanking">8</a>] and although a 
        lot of this can be expressed through ccTLD there are some proposed gTLD 
        which will encapsulate more specific geolocation through city 
        information with TLD such as <code>.london</code> or <code>.nyc</code>.
        Of course the restrictions on this would have to be fairly tight and it
        may be almost impossible to police. Search engines are therefore likely
        to take the TLD information with a pinch of salt, but it may open up 
        the market for products relating to country information, cologne, for 
        example, could be used for the advertisement of fragrances.
      </p>
      <p>
        In hand with this, the ability to register a TLD for a professional 
        career, a doctor for example, seems like a ideal way of stopping false
        advertising. These could prove to be easier to police, but again there 
        is no guarantee that a person owning a domain with the TLD 
        <code>.doctor</code> is indeed a doctor.
      </p>
      <p>
        For businesses that can help perform segment focusing, isolating the 
        target demographics to those TLD which appeal to them, be it art or 
        football.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even with this, there is already a lot of misinformation and ignorance 
        as to how the internet really works in the general population that these 
        gTLD may not be effective as hypothesised.
      </p>

      <h3>Technical Issues in the Expansion of TLDs</h3>
      <p>
        There have not been many technical issues with the root zone of DNS 
        until fairly recently; two factors had helped in the stabilisation of
        this [<a href="#manning2011challenges" 
                 name="cite-manning2011challenges">9</a>]:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>There were a fairly small number of TLD, allowing the size of the
            root to be around 80,000 bytes.</li>
        <li>TLDs were absorbed very slowly into the root zone and these
            changes were relatively small.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
       Now, with the introduction of new gTLD and ITLD, there are going to be 
       many more root zone entries and this increase is happening quite 
       quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only are there going to be more TLD required, additional factors
        like the new IPv6 protocol and  the need for security in DNS through 
        DNSSEC[<a href="#rfc2535" name="cite-rfc2535">10</a>]. All these 
        factors combined means that the size of a DNS query or response may not
        fit inside a 512 byte UDP packet DNS was initially intended to handle.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several options to cope with this; one approach would be to 
        send a UDP packet greater than 512 bytes, another would be to use TCP 
        to handle the sending of packets which are larger than 512 bytes. DNS 
        itself is able to handle both of these options, but neither are 
        particularly desirable options.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sending large UDP packets over a network may run into the problem of 
        requiring fragmentation if size of the path MTU is less than the size 
        of the packet needing to be sent.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other option, using TCP, has a large amount of overhead involved, 
        both in terms of packet size in adding the information required to 
        perform a connection in TCP and also in terms of network traffic for 
        the three-way handshake and for acknowledging received packets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both these methods bring about problems when encountering firewalls. 
        An incorrectly configured firewall might be set to not accept DNS 
        packets with a size greater than 512 bytes via UDP (the National 
        Institute of Standards and Technology estimate that DNSSEC will 
        increase the DNS response size to be <em>at least</em> 2048 bytes), so 
        a response from a DNSSEC signed response would be dropped by the 
        firewall.
      </p>
      <p>
        An incorrectly firewall would likely drop DNS traffic sent using TCP, 
        the alternative for sending larger DNS messages. This means that the 
        potential worst-case scenario is that DNS traffic signed using DNSSEC
        would not be resolved at all and it would fall back to using unsigned 
        DNS messages, but having caused a lot of traffic on the network.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other problem comes with the path MTU size. The guidelines for 
        using DNSSEC state that the client must be able to accept DNS messages 
        of at least 2048 bytes, the MTU size of the path these packets would 
        have to traverse may be limited to a smaller amount, requiring the 
        packets to be fragmented, which may lead to data loss and redundant 
        retransmission, or for TCP to be considered, with all of its overheads.
      </p>
      <p>
        This may become less of a problem as the MTU size increases as networks
        are improved with modern technology, such as fibre optics. But the path
        MTU is limited by the weakest link in the chain so this may remain a
        problem for many years to come.
      </p>

      <h4>DNS Security</h4>
      <p>
        In recent years, the need for security in the DNS has become apparent,
        simple attacks like DNS Spoofing, where the response from a DNS query 
        is not for the correct server, but instead for a different server, 
        typically the attackers. One method of doing this is DNS Cache 
        Poisoning[<a href="#davies2008cache" 
                     name="cite-davies2008cache">11</a>], where the principal 
        of saving lookup time by caching results leads to the wrong result 
        being cached for as long as the TTL of the cache. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This can even affect servers from the root zones when a name server 
        provides both an authoritative and recursive name service. An attack on
        the recursive side could lead to an authoritative answer being given 
        based on bad data. This can even lead to insertions or modification of 
        domain data inside a TLD.
      </p>
      <p>
        The formal solution to this is to introduce security to the DNS through
        public key cryptography to sign the responses given by the recursive 
        DNS lookup, allowing the response to be verified by the client. DNSSEC 
        is the mechanism used to perform this process.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main issue with DNSSEC is that it is a complex system which 
        requires a decent level of expertise to set up and is only applicable 
        to a fairly small proportion of businesses. This, combined with a lack 
        of application support for DNSSEC means that, at the moment at least, 
        the reward for implementing DNSSEC is often not worth the 
        risk[<a href="#rasmussen2011risk" name="cite-rasmussen2011risk">12</a>].
      </p>

      <h4>DNS Support for IPv6</h4>
      <p>
        The DNS cannot be easily extended to support IPv6 addresses, since it 
        is assumed by clients that a 32-bit IPv4 address will be returned and 
        not a 128-bit IPv6 address.
      </p>
      <p>
       A new resource record was implemented in DNS to accommodate IPv6 
       addresses, the AAAA record, by 
       RFC3596[<a href="#rfc3596" name="cite-rfc3596">13</a>].
      </p>
      <p>
        The main issue brought about by these changes in DNS is the increase of
        size in the query/response messages due to the four times increase in 
        number of bit required to represent the IP address.
      </p>

      <h4>IDNs and Issues with Unicode</h4>
      <p>
        There is also the question of the safety of using a non-Latin encoding
        (e.g. Unicode) where certain characters may look either very similar or
        even indistinguishable to one 
        another[<a href="#kaufman2013unicode" 
                   name="cite-kaufman2013unicode">14</a>]. This can lead to the
        spoofing of known domain names which attackers could use for malicious 
        purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, the registration of IDN at the root zone is restricted to
        prevent this[<a href="#icann2011idns" 
                        name="cite-icann2011idns">15</a>], but that has not 
        meant that the implementation of IDN has not caused issues with other 
        areas involving non-Latin encoding, The Homograph 
        Attack[<a href="#gabrilovich2002homograph" 
                  name="cite-gabrilovich2002homograph">16</a>], for example.
      </p>

      <h3>Evaluation</h3>
      <p>
        It is obvious that the need for new TLD is an important step; however, 
        it seems like a step that has taken far too long to put into place. A 
        lot of arguments are now made that the use of search engines has 
        deprecated the need for a truly memorable URL, let alone a TLD and 
        whilst the reserved TLDs for government and educational purposes do 
        make these institutions easily recognisable and verifiable, the levels 
        of information the proposed gTLD could offer seem too detailed and too 
        difficult to police for the little information they would provide to 
        the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another argument one could make against the new TLD is that sites 
        providing URL shortening or technologies such as QRCode are now more 
        popular methods of sharing location information more memorably and 
        would seem to have sprung up as a way around the lack of domains 
        available.
      </p>
      <p>
        The need for technologies like DNSSEC should be obvious to all users, 
        but when different technologies like TLS also provide a similar 
        service, with a lot of added benefits, publicity and only when 
        required, one does wonder whether the need for it is quite so pressing,
        especially given the overhead that would be added by DNSSEC especially 
        if a lot of users have incorrectly configured firewalls, ones on a 
        router provided by their ISP for example.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, DNSSEC is at least an automatic process where domain names 
        which do not match the signature would be heralded with a large warning
        from the browser, whilst technologies like TLS are not guaranteed to, 
        or might be used where users might assume it is (e.g. spoof websites 
        using HTTP rather than HTTPS would not show any warning).
      </p>
      <p>
        DNS support for IPv6 is already fairly good and even though it does 
        increase the packet size, it is necessary step to help the widespread
        adoption of IPv6. One might tentatively predict that the packet size 
        might be able to become somewhat smaller once IPv4 becomes less 
        prevalent, but it would undoubtedly be many years before this happens.
