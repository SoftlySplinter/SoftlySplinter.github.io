          <h2>Mobile Devices have made us the most monitored individuals in history</h2>
        </header>
        <p class="foreward">
          This was an marked essay as part of my university degree, but as it was
          such an interesting subject to research I thought it would be good to
          put up online.
        </p>
  
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          There has been a lot of news in the press in the last year about 
          surveillance programs run by many countries security agencies, 
          particularly focused on the collection of phone records by the National
          Security Agency (NSA)[<a href="#Xgreenwald2013nsa" id="cite-Xgreenwald2013nsa">1</a>]. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It comes as no surprise that this has brought about the question:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "Have mobile devices made us the most monitored individuals in 
           history?"
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          To fully understand the depth of this question, one must consider the 
          technical methods which are employed to monitor mobile devices and how 
          these methods differ across different mobile platforms. In hand with 
          this, one must investigate the methods for preventing unwanted 
          monitoring on mobile devices and how effective these methods really 
          are.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally there are many legal and professional issues which govern the 
          collection of data from mobile devices; but there are also a host of 
          ethical and social issues which legal and professional element cannot, 
          necessarily, cover.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course monitoring of data, especially from mobile devices, doesn't 
          have to be used for nefarious purposes. Applications commonly use data 
          mining techniques to provide a better experience for their users and 
          cloud services are so popular that imagining a world where all a users
          data is stored solely on a single device is almost impossible.
        </p>
  
        <h3>Technical Methods for Monitoring Mobile Devices</h3>
        <p>
          Because of the structure of the Global System for Mobile Communications
          (GSM), any mobile device which accesses the mobile network can be 
          tracked to, at worst, the nearest cell tower. In fact the NSA is known 
          to use this data to track targets and identify possible accomplices[<a 
          href="#Xclassified2012co-travel" id="cite-Xclassified2012co-travel">2</a>]. There are also other stories of
          UK public organisations performing similar actions[<a 
          href="#Xgallager2011met" id="cite-Xgallager2011met">3</a>][<a href="#Xhopkins2013gchq" id="cite-Xhopkins2013gchq">4</a>].
        </p>
        <p>
          Though this is a worrying concept, there is some important information
          that the U.S. has given in [<a href="#Xclapper2013facts" id="cite-Xclapper2013facts">5</a>] which 
          denies that any information collected cannot be used to target any 
          individual without a prior specific and documented reason to do so. In 
          the case of monitoring of non-U.S. citizens there must also be a 
          agreement with the country of their citizenship.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the monitoring which the users agrees to have performed upon them
          that is perhaps more worrying.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mobile devices, especially tablets and smart phones, have a range of 
          sensors which third-party applications may be able to access. These 
          sensors typically include a camera, microphone, WiFi antenna and GPS 
          system. As technology progresses the accuracy of these sensors is 
          increasing and other sensors such as accelerometers are becoming more
          prevalent.
        </p>
        <p>
          It could, therefore, be easy for an attacker to write a malicious 
          application which simply monitored the GPS location of a person or 
          recorded their conversations through the microphone. Or even use any of
          these systems combined to gather a lot of sensitive data.
        </p>
        <p>
          There have been cases which have been formally investigated[<a 
          href="#Xftc2013flashlight" id="cite-Xftc2013flashlight">6</a>] in which legitimate applications 
          collect data from users on the side, which are then sold to other 
          companies for advertisement revenue.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, a lot of applications have legitimate uses for these sensors.
          Most applications
          require network access to load data from external servers. More 
          specific applications, which perform tasks like route tracking, will 
          require the use of more than one of these sensors.
        </p>
  
        <h3>Protection Against Unwanted Monitoring</h3>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, due to the structure of the GSM network, as long as a 
          mobile device is on and allowed to connect to the network it can be 
          tracked. With the addition of a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card 
          it can even be tied to a specific individual. Under [<a 
          href="#Xdirective2006/24/EC" id="cite-Xdirective2006/24/EC">7</a>] 
          organisations can even request this information from GSM network 
          providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Modern mobile platforms typically have some sort of security system and
          ways in which applications can be given access to secure elements of in
          the mobile device. Most of these platforms sandbox third-party 
          application allowing the kernel to control the access to the various 
          facilities of the device.
        </p>
  
        <h4>Android Security Facilities</h4>
        <p>
          [<a href="#Xgoogle2013security" id="cite-Xgoogle2013security">8</a>] 
          describes the methods that the Android system uses to secure the 
          environment. The main advantage Android gains in this area is that uses
          Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux), which confines the access of 
          programs based on different policies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Android adds many features on top of this, the most applicable of these
          to the question of monitoring is the permission model. For a third 
          party application to access protected APIs such at GPS positioning or
          network connections they must implicitly define which of these elements
          they require in the manifest file of the application.
        </p>
        <p>
          This information is displayed to the user when they first install the 
          application and when the application updates to add new access to 
          secure APIs.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are also certain APIs which are not available to third-party 
          applications, but which may be used by pre-installed applications if 
          they are signed as part of the OS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because applications are sandboxed from one another it should be an 
          impossible task to gain confidential information from another 
          application, unless it provides it somehow.
        </p>
  
        <h5>Additional Security Features Provided by the Google Play Store</h5>
  
        <p>
          Obviously, telling legitimate use of secure API elements from 
          illegitimate use is not an easy task, especially for automated systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the mobile ecosystem, the typical method of performing this is to 
          have a trusted place, where developers can distribute their 
          applications. In the case of Android this is usually the Google Play 
          store, however other stores such as the Amazon Appstore do also exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          The maintainers of such places can then regulate the applications 
          accepted, monitor them for any malicious activities and remove them 
          where needed. Google even added a service in 2012 which scanned the 
          Play store for applications with a malicious intent by running them on 
          a range of emulated services[<a href="#Xlockheimer2012android" 
          id="cite-Xlockheimer2012android">9</a>].
        </p>
  
        <h4>iOS Security Facilities</h4>
        <p>
          [<a href="#Xapple2012security" id="cite-Xapple2012security">10</a>] 
          defines the methods that the iOS system uses to secure the environment.
          Similar to Android iOS third-party applications are sandboxed from each
          other, although a lot of this is done by the iOS runtime. All 
          applications have their own file spaces which can only be accessed 
          through the iOS defined API.
        </p>
        <p>
          Access to secure API elements is defined through entitlements; signed 
          key-value pairs specific to applications. However, it should be noted 
          that these entitlements are not required to access elements such as the
          GPS or microphone and are more typically used by system applications 
          and daemons to perform tasks that would typically require root access.
        </p>
        <p>
          The iOS ecosystem is heavily reliant on the Apple App Store to provide 
          security against the malicious collection of data from iOS 
          applications. Because all applications have to be reviewed before being
          accepted into the Apple App Store, and because it is difficult to 
          install applications not from the App Store, ones with a malicious 
          purpose are somewhat unlikely to be accepted.
        </p>
        <p>
          [<a href="#Xapple2010review" id="cite-Xapple2010review">11</a>] depicts
          these guidelines. These guidelines state that the application must gain
          user consent before using location data and transmitting user data. Any
          application which doesn't adhere to these guidelines will be rejected.
        </p>
  
        <h3>Implications of Mobile-based Monitoring</h3>
        <p>
          This section will focus on the four main implications of developing 
          software which gathers data from mobile devices; legal, professional, 
          social and ethical.
        </p>
  
        <h4>Legal Implications</h4>
        <p>
          There are several laws which govern the legalities of computer software
          and the storage of personal data. The notable laws which apply to the
          monitoring of data gathered by mobile devices are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Data Protection Act[<a href="#Xdpa1998" id="cite-Xdpa1998">12</a>]</li>
          <li>Computer Misuse Act[<a href="#Xcma1990" id="cite-xcma1990">13</a>]</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Other laws may still apply to the process of developing the software 
          which performs this, but are less relevant to the actual collection of 
          data.
        </p>
  
        <h5>Impacts of the Data Protection Act</h5>
        <p>
          Monitoring data undoubtedly also means storing data and any 
          computerised data falls under the Data Protection Act; therefore, any 
          monitoring is going to be affected by the Data Protection Act.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has released guidelines[<a 
          href="#Xico2012cloud" id="cite-Xico2012cloud">14</a>] on the use of 
          cloud computing and how it can be kept legal within the Data Protection
          Act. These mainly state that it is essential to have a contract in 
          place with a trusted cloud storage provider that will adhere to UK law.
          This might be especially difficult with many cloud providers being 
          non-UK or even -EU based.
        </p>
        <p>
          The EU has made agreements with the US government for a safe harbour
          for private data that could be stored on US servers[<a
          href="#Xeu2000safe">15</a>], this does help with some issues that
          storing data on a non-EU cloud, but given the way in which clouds
          tend to operate, there is no non-contractual way in which this can be
          guaranteed.
        </p>

        <h5>Impacts of the Computer Misuse Act</h5>
        <p>
          The Computer Misuse Act does not affect the use of mobile devices for
          monitoring purposes as much as one would suspect. The main issue
          comes that section 1 of this act defines misuse as "the unauthorised
          access to computer material"[<a href="#Xcma1990">13</a>]. Sections 2
          and 3 also define other forms of misuse, but as monitoring would fall
          under the access of computer material, they do not apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem comes that the access could be implied simply by the user
          installing the application. Most applications will also have terms
          and conditions or will be distributed in such a way that the user is
          accepting the access to information providing by sensors before they
          install the application (e.g. the Android permission system).
        </p>
        <p>
          Obviously, if an application could hide the fact it was collecting
          data from a permission system and does not disclose this use in terms
          and conditions, then an argument could be made that it is breaking
          this act.
        </p>
 
        <h4>Professional Implications</h4>
        <p>
          Section 1.a of the BSC Code of Conduct states that "[You shall] have
          due regard for the public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of
          others and the environment"[<a href="#Xbsc2011conduct">16</a>]. This
          would imply that you must secure any data collected through the
          monitoring of mobile devices. Having due regard for an individuals
          privacy, might also imply that the results of the monitoring must be
          kept private, and not, for example, sold to another company to
          generate revenue.
        </p>

  <!--l. 264--><p>   Section 2.f also discusses avoidance of malicious and negligent action which could imply
  that any professional should not be developing a system which monitors mobile devices for
  malicious purposes.
        </p>
  
   <h4>Social Implications</h4>
  <!--l. 271--><p>There is a lot of good that can come from the monitoring of mobile devices and as mentioned
  there may be many good reasons for application developers to perform monitoring. Android
  4.0 added the ability to monitor roaming data usage, so a user could set a warning
  message when they reach a certain amount of usage, and to cap their usage at a
  different limit[<a 
  href="#Xandroid2011ics">17</a>]; this feature gives the user more control over the use of their mobile
  phone, and prevents them from spending more than they need to on their phone
  bill.
        </p>
  <!--l. 279--><p>   Given that less that 1% of all UK premises receive no 3G connection from any provider
  and that only around 23% of all geographical areas in the UK receive no 3G connection from
  any provider[<a 
  href="#Xoffcom2013infastructure">18</a>] and that the figures for 2G connections are even less, it is difficult to not be
  connected to a form of network. With the recent adoption of 4G networks these figures are
  likely to decrease even further.
        </p>
  <!--l. 286--><p>   Given that a lot of services provide synchronisation to the cloud, it is difficult to escape
  the pressures of work when emails can be delivered to a mobile device so easily. There have
  been studies into the affects of using email constantly against taking vacations from
  emails leading to reduced stress and increased productivity[<a 
  href="#Xmark2012pace">19</a>]. Similar studies
  have also been performed on the mental welfare through the increased use of
  Facebook[<a 
  href="#Xkross2013facebook">20</a>], where increased use lead to the increased chances of depression in young
  adults.
        </p>
  <!--l. 295--><p>   Monitoring data could be one of the possible reasons why there are such stresses in
  modern day life, but it could also allow stress to be reduced by limiting access to certain
  applications or suggesting improvements to fitness and diet.
        </p>
  
   <h4>Ethical Implications</h4>
  <!--l. 302--><p>The final consideration is that of ethics; it may be legal, professional and socially acceptable
  to develop an application which monitors some information from a users device, but the
  purpose or reasons for doing so may not be ethical.
        </p>
  <!--l. 307--><p>   Of course ethics are a very personal viewpoint, to help standardise ethics, the Computer
  Ethics Institute has released ten commandments[<a 
  href="#XceiXcommandments">21</a>] which, if followed, would deem a
  application ethical.
        </p>
  <!--l. 311--><p>   The author has his own views on what makes an application ethical; using Android as an
  example, there should be a reasonable explanation as to why an application wants to access
  a protected API and this reason should be presented to the user, rather than just the protect
  API elements an application has.
        </p>
  
   <h3>Conclusions</h3>
  <!--l. 318--><p>Yes, mobile devices have probably aided in being the most monitored individuals in
  history. To say mobile devices are the only reason for this would be an unsound
  argument; though location could be seen as more sensitive than internet history, for
  example.
        </p>
  <!--l. 323--><p>   Mobile devices just add a lot more ways in which individuals can be monitored; however,
  the access to these systems is more strictly controlled compared to the standard PCs or
  laptops. Whilst this is a good step in the right direction, there are also additional items which
  cannot be so strictly controlled as it is stored one systems external to the device (i.e. the
  GSM network).
