Once again I have set up a blog. Initially Octopress was considered, but due to
Celes (the VPS this is hosted on) does not like Ruby, I decided to find an 
alternative for Python instead.

Pelican was a neat alternative for this and seems pretty nifty. We shall see 
how it goes, but being able to blog in vim certainly has itâ€™s niceties.
