                <p>Last Monday I had a very near&nbsp;miss.</p>
<p>In the early afternoon, when my girlfriend was about to make a nice late lunch, I got a call, which followed this sort of&nbsp;line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="caps">DC</span> Williamson: Hello this is <span class="caps">DC</span> Williamson of Hammersimth police. Is Mr Brown&nbsp;in?</p>
<p>Me: Yes speaking, actually is it for me or my&nbsp;father?</p>
<p><span class="caps">DC</span> Williamson: Your father, actually this might concern you too. I’ve apprehended a suspect who claims to be your father’s grandchild and has cloned copies of both your&nbsp;cards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point I’m already stressed. Hearing someone has cloned your cards is never good news and as I’m an only child and don’t have any&nbsp;children.</p>
<p>The conversation continues on, this nice man provides me with his badge number, some reference numbers and asks me to call the number on the back of my bank card to get in touch with my bank. Also saying that I can call him at anytime through 101 and just ask for his department and badge&nbsp;number.</p>
<p>I proceded to call my bank, chat to the nice advisor there who found a payment for an Apple Mac Pro (and made it void) then found a transaction from another of my accounts which could not be stopped. His advice was to withdraw as much money as possible so that the withdrawal limit would stop that transaction from happening at 5pm. He had also had his manager listen back to the phone call which had initiated this transfer and had found that the security on it wasn’t high&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>The conversation continued at this point a bit like&nbsp;so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Advisor: Where is your local branch? Can you get to it before 4:30pm when it&nbsp;closes?</p>
<p>Me: Yes, its&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>Advisor: Oh, well there’s actually an investigation going on with local police into that branch and we believe one person in there may be working with these people. When you withdraw the money its essential that you do not mention fraud or anything to that effect. Say you want to buy a new car or&nbsp;something.</p>
<p>Me: Would it be easier to go to another&nbsp;branch?</p>
<p>Advisor: No, its better going to your normal branch and acting&nbsp;casual.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He reeled off some more spiel about how he was now my personal banker and that I shouldn’t talk to anyone else. He would call me back in 30-45 minutes to continue on the&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>Okay, stressed and worried I rushed to my branch, withdrew as much money as possible in cash and came home. There I decided to update <span class="caps">DC</span> Williamson on how things were&nbsp;going.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>101 Switchboard: Hello, who are you&nbsp;after?</p>
<p>Me: <span class="caps">DC</span> Williamson, badge number&nbsp;<span class="caps">EK1</span>.</p>
<p>101 Switchboard: There is no one here by that name and that number is&nbsp;fake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cue nasty sinking&nbsp;feeling.</p>
<p>All the time speaking to “<span class="caps">DC</span> Williamson” and my “bank advisor” I had, in fact, been speaking to the same person. The <span class="caps">PC</span> on the switchboard asked if the call had been something along the lines of: A suspect was apprehended with your card cloned. You were told to call your advisor who asked for information as part of security… Apparently this is a growing&nbsp;scam.</p>
<p>I had made a serious <span class="caps">PEBKAC</span> error; I assumed “<span class="caps">DC</span> Williamson” hung up before I called the bank and I myself didn’t hang&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>I spoke to my bank’s fraud team and just after finishing talking to them I got a call back from the scammer who I told to, polietely, bugger&nbsp;off.</p>
<p>I’ve been back to my local branch to pay the money back in and to inform them of this scam. They gave me a few pointers for the&nbsp;future:</p>
<p>Your bank will never advise you to withdraw money from your&nbsp;account.</p>
<p>Always hang up the phone&nbsp;properly.</p>
<p>If you don’t trust a call, try to keep them on the line and seperately call the police, even if they have withheld their number it may still be traceable (this is something the bank clerks themselves are advised to&nbsp;do).</p>
<p>Luckily I didn’t lose anything other than a little intrest on my account; talking to my family the assumption is that this “advisor” would have had me pay money into a “temporary account” he had set up for&nbsp;me.</p>
