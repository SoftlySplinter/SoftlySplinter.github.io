On September 3rd, I was lucky enough to attend the 8th International Symposium on Image and Signal Processing and Analysis (ISPA 2013) which also happened to be my first academic conference. The reason for attending this was to present a paper and to generally network with other academics.

The paper was entitled “Can we date an artists work from catalogue photographs?”, presented in the special session on digital imaging in cultural heritage. The paper came from my third year project at Aberystwyth University on Kyffin Williams.

The conference was definitely an interesting experience; some talks were just brain meltingly in-depth but some, perhaps more importantly, weren’t all that impressive due to lack of experimentation or methodology.

The special session on Digital Imaging in Cultural Heritage (which the paper was included in) was a really good session with some impressive research and implementation of existing ideas. The Cultural Heritage Omni-Stereo Panoramas for Immersive Cultural Analytics - From the Nile to the Hijaz was of note for myself, not just because of the implementation of the research, but being able to try out the Oculus Rift. It works surprisingly well for those with eyesight problems.

The session on Image Segmentation was another interesting one, Computationally Efficient Approximations of Complex Image Segmentation Metrics and Coverage segmentation of thin structures by linear unmixing and local centre of gravity attraction were both really good pieces of research. The former was a very detailed and well researched paper, while the latter brought forward a really useful idea which I’d love to try out for a real problem.

The keynote by Professor Andrea Cavallaro was one of the best talks I have been to and, although it was cut short due to time, gave a very good introduction into the world of video tracking.

Finally, the session on 3-D Imaging was a very interesting one, partly because it was a session I wouldn’t have normally attended, but because of another Aberystwyth student, Yittin Zhao, it was nice to support another fellow. His talk on Contrast-based Surface Saliency was quite interesting, although a little in depth for myself. On 2.5D Surface Reconstruction of Cell Cultures was another interesting talk in the session.

Outside the conference, I can say that Trieste is a lovely place, quite similar to Aberystwyth (but larger). Although the distance from the airport to the city is only slightly expensive if you arrive just as the two-hourly bus departs.

So all-in-all, some brain-melting image processing, some real enthusiasm and more than just a little free wine at the conference reception (but I stayed behind my supervisor, so its all good ;)).
