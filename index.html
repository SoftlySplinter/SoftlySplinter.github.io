            <p class="cite cite-description">
                <i class="bi bi-card-text"></i> Using image processing techniques, such as colour-space analysis, image
                filtering, and other digitial image analysis tools to predict the date a piece of artwork was produced
                using k-nearest neighbour (kNN) classiciation and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) to rank how
                succesful each technique was. Contrasted with exemplars picked by a domain expert. All to answer the
                question, "Can we date an artist's work from catalogue photographs?".
